The rule of date comparisons can be simplified as such: $effective_date <= $any_valid_date < $expiration_date. 
That is, an expiration date of today means that the record had expired at midnight last night, and is therefore inactive. 
However, an effective date of today means that it became active on midnight, and therefore is active.

I'll say the same thing with more detail. Date comparisons are made using the following pattern, 
where $today is a given date by which you're querying your model:
    
    [php]
    if ($today < $expiration_date) {
        // record is NOT expired
    }
    if ($today >= $expiration_date) {
        // record IS expired
    }
    if ($today < $effective_date) {
        // record is NOT active yet
    }
    if ($today >= $expiration_date) {
        // record HAS become active
    }

There are a few reasons for doing this:

* Temporal neighbors are easy to find ($left->exp_date == $right->eff_date)
* No addition/subtraction needs to be done when creating new temporal segments
** $new->eff_date = date('Y-m-d', date_add($old->exp_date, new DateInterval('+1 day')))
** vs.
** $new->eff_date = $old->exp_date
* Terminating records is intuitive ($record->exp_date = $today)
* Creating new records is intuitive ($record->eff_date = $today)
