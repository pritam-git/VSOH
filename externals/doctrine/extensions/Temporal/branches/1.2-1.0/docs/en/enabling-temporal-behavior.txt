You can enable the temporal behavior on any given model simply by adding `Temporal` as an actAs option.

Below is an example model named `Subscription` to which we will add the Temporal behavior.

    [yml]
    Subscription:
        actAs: [Temporal]
        columns:
            id:
                type:           integer(10)
                unsigned:       true
                primary:        true
                autoincrement:  true
            customer_id:
                type:           integer(10)
                unsigned:       true
                notnull:        true
            product_id:
                type:           integer(10)
                unsigned:       true
                notnull:        true

Now when we build our models we will have the effective and expiration columns added, 
plus some handy functions for date-based queries, row versioning, and temporal key constraints.
