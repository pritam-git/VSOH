The `Temporal` extension is a behavior which adds Temporal (time-oriented) support for your model class.

The main change that you will notice when adding this behavior is that your table has two additional columns defined, eff_date and exp_date. 
Used on their own with no extra work, these columns are useful for logging - but other features for date-based queries, row versioning, 
and temporal key constraints make managing temporal data fairly easy.
