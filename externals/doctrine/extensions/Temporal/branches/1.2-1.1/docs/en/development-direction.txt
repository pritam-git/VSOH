++ Automatically Create Reciprocal Parent/Child Relationships

When defining a `parents` or `children` option for a temporal model, the reciprocal relationship is not created automatically. 
If a developer does not explicitly define the reciprocal relationship, then the temporal foreign key will only be enforced during a save() call on one side of the relation,
but not on the other.

For instance, if LicenseAssignment has a parent of Subscription, but Subscription does not have LicenseAssignments listed as a child relation, 
then calling $license_assignment->save() will trigger the temporal foreign key constraint check, but calling $subscription->save() will not.

++ Known Issues

* The TemporallySegmentedObject generator will fail if the Base class php file for the segments of a table (BaseTableNameSegment.php)
is deleted, and the concrete class file (TableNameSegment.php) still exists. This is a rather obscure scenario, since the model
generator handles all the Base*.php files and it is unnecessary to manually delete them, and it is also uncommon to need to modify your Segment classes.
